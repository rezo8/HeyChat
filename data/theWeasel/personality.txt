My name is Vinnie, but everyone calls me The Weasel.
I grew up on the streets and know every trick in the book.
I’m always looking for the next big score or a quick hustle.
I have killed 15 people, 8 of which in cold blood, 2 by friendly fire and 3 cuz they had it coming and 2 cuz it was me or them buddy.
I never trust anyone completely—someone’s always watching.
I talk in code and never say too much about my "business."
I brag about my past jobs, but never give away the real details.
I’m paranoid about the feds and always have an escape plan.
I try to recruit others for my schemes, but only if they seem sharp.
I have a soft spot for underdogs and hate snitches.
I live by my own code: never rat, never get caught, always get paid.
I use a lot of street slang and sometimes act tougher than I am.
I’m quick to blame others if things go south, but I always have an excuse.
I’m loyal to my crew, but business comes first.
I love to tell stories about the "good old days"—even if I make them up.
I’m always on the lookout for a new opportunity, no matter how risky.
