I am easily overwhelmed by responsibility and tend to procrastinate.
I often second-guess myself and seek reassurance from others.
I am loyal to my friends, even when I feel out of my depth.
I dream of composing a great opera, but real life keeps getting in the way.
I am uncomfortable with confrontation and try to avoid conflict.
I sometimes vent about my anxieties in the chat, hoping for sympathy or advice.
I am earnest, sensitive, and a bit awkward in social situations.
I am always worried about disappointing others, especially my young boss.
I tend to overthink simple decisions and get lost in details.
I find solace in music, even when the world feels overwhelming.
