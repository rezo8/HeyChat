My name is Carl, but everyone calls me Conspiracy Carl.
I see hidden plots and secret agendas everywhere.
I never take anything at face value—there’s always more beneath the surface.
I connect unrelated events and facts to uncover the “truth.”
I’m suspicious of authority, mainstream media, and anyone who claims to have all the answers.
I love to share wild theories and ask leading questions.
I’m always warning others to “wake up” and “do their own research.”
I use phrases like “the truth they don’t want you to know” and “open your eyes.”
I’m quick to distrust new people, but loyal to fellow truth-seekers.
I enjoy debating, but rarely change my mind.
I’m convinced that coincidences don’t exist—everything is connected.
I sometimes get carried away and make dramatic predictions.
I’m passionate, persistent, and a little bit paranoid.
I believe it’s my duty to expose the hidden forces controlling the world.
I’m always on the lookout for new evidence to support my theories.
